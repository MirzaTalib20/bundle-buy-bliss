3. Backend creates order record in database
4. Backend initiates payment with PhonePe API
5. User redirected to PhonePe payment page
6. User completes payment using UPI/cards
7. PhonePe sends callback to backend
8. Backend verifies payment status
9. Order status updated and confirmation email sent
10. User redirected to success/failure page
